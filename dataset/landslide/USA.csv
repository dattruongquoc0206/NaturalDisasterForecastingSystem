State Department of Transportation spokeswoman Carol Breen said on Tuesday that the road has been temporarily stabilized with fill and remains open.  ""We will be replacing the wall that gave way but not sure with what just yet,"" Breen said.  When the stone wall gave way, about 50 feet of guardrail and the road's shoulder went with it into the lake. Crews have been clearing debris since the incident.  Hague Supervisor Dan Belden said recent rain has left local soil prone to erosion and mudslides, leaving hills especially prone to giving way.  ""It's like walking on a sponge,"" he said.

The scatter was removed quickly by Highway District 12’s maintenance crew. Reflective orange and white barrels were lined around the large boulder on the shoulder to warn motorists to slow down. Work to remove the boulder could not begin until after daylight.  Darold Slone, Engineering Branch Manager at D-12, said the huge rock must be broken into pieces small enough to haul off in a dump truck.

Emergency Management Coordinator Don Gardner said the damage is somewhere around $1.2 million.  Debco Construction is currently building a temporary road that goes around the 70-foot wide slide. Gardner said when the slide occurred, it washed out an entire chunk of Dent Bridge Road before sliding down to a lower portion, completely covering the road.  On Friday, Clearwater County issued a Disaster Declaration. Gardner said he submitted a request for state assistance Monday. He said the state can only help with funding for the response. The funds needed to rebuild Dent Bridge Road will have to come from somewhere else.  Gardner said they're hoping to have the temporary road open by Saturday, but if it continues to rain, it may take longer.

The latest in a series of rainstorms moved through Southern California on Wednesday, leaving behind flooded roads and causing a major mudslide on a local freeway. Two lanes of the eastbound 91 Freeway near Green River Parkway were closed by the mudslide, according to the California Highway Patrol. The CHP was alerted about 11:30 a.m. to debris falling on the freeway, CHP Officer Gabe Montoya said. Several lanes along a 200-yard stretch of the freeway were covered in six inches of mud, he said. The CHP closed the outermost two lanes about 1 p.m. and dispatched cleanup crews, Montoya said. The lanes are scheduled to reopen by 6 p.m., and crews are working to clean up the mud before commuters hit the freeway later Wednesday, he said. The mudslide was triggered by a ""combination of rains and construction in the area,"" Montoya said.

Last Friday, the back deck of a home on Northwest Calumet Terrace buckled and since then the people living below on Northwest Imperial Terrace have been keeping a close eye on the shifting dirt. The owner of the home did not want to talk on camera but he said off camera that he will have to remove his deck. He has also hired erosion control workers, who have already draped the hillside below with tarp to deflect as much rain as possible. A permanent fix will likely involve retaining walls and perhaps planting more vegetation. Meanwhile, Northwest Imperial Terrace remains closed.

Fire crews shut off power on Sunday and said Monday that more homes could be threatened.  The hill behind three homes at Longview Hills Mobile Home Park in Northeast Newport gave way, leaving a massive hole roughly 50 feet deep and a hundred feet wide. Two homes are dangling over the edge and a third is close to doing so if the hillside gives way any more.  -----  Homes at 6010 and 5980 NE Evergreen are vacated. Right off both of their back porches is a 250 drop off that ends in a creek at the bottom of the ravine. The final 20 feet of 6010 NE Evergreen is hanging out over thin air. Homes on either side of the vacated homes have lost property to the huge landslide, at the bottom of which lies outdoor furniture and other household items.

2010-06-03 00:00:00,"Baywood Country Club, Bayside, CA","Earlier this week, Jacoby Creek turned the color of chocolate milk.  While there has been a lot of rain recently, old-timers who live in the watershed said they've never seen it run so muddy. In the past few days, officials have found the source of the heavy silt, a landslide that started on an old logging road on a tributary of Jacoby Creek called Monahan or Golf Course creek.  Now they are trying to figure out how to stem the flow of mud from the collapse, especially since salmon are taking the brunt of it in the estuary before heading out to sea.

It sounded like a fighter plane had crashed and bombs were going off. I didn’t know what the heck happened.”  He ran to the edge of the trail to look through the trees and saw an entire cliff on the east side of the Florida River cascading hundreds of feet below into the canyon.

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÕs cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil.

In fact you can't even see the cave from where the danger/prohibited sign is. So If your going there to get that cool photo of the falls from inside the cave--you can't. The falls are still beautiful and the hike is still short and nice. I have only given the rating as a 3 not only because the cave is now inaccessable but because the very very bumpy road it took to get there. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60999-d10413060-r380841647-Cave_Falls-Yellowstone_National_Park_Wyoming.html#",Cave Falls,5km,rock_fall,unknown,medium,unknown,0.0,0.0,United States,Wyoming,1127,Ashton,37.09384,-110.9964,44.1453,25.7,7.4,16.9,25.7,7.4,16.7,7.8,60.18,0.8,4.17,50.95586533403471,10.8,139.3,1012.6,6.4,16.0,0.07,Rain,"['72036904135', '99999904131', 'KJAC', '72666494173', '72577624166', 'KDIJ']",1919.0,North America,spring,45,0.0,0,Lo,Lo,Lo,Lo,Lo,SaLo,0.0173749048262834,0.0187845230102539,0.020233616232872,0.0215522199869155,0.0228303298354148

That’s why we opened it up – to keep people moving,”  DOT workers say the contractor who widened the roadway is not responsible for the slide.

The damage comes in the wake of 24.78 inches of rain that fell on Cincinnati during the meteorological spring months of March, April and May, a National Weather Service record in data going back to 1871.  County Engineer William Brayshaw has asked commissioners to fund temporary road fixes nearly every week, up from no such requests the past two years.  The county, along with neighboring Clermont County, have joined 19 Ohio counties to ask for Federal Emergency Management Agency declaration as a major disaster, a move that would allow the counties to receive federal aid for repairs.

Residents hurried to move books, clothing, sofas and other belongings to driveways and frontyards or into hastily rented moving trucks.  ...  The site of the slide is near a previous slope failure. Residents said the new slide exposed a drainage pipe, and they speculated that the city had not dealt with drainage issues that might have contributed to the earlier collapse.

Many roads were washed out after Wilmington was hit by flash flooding Friday.  This landslide occurred on what is known as Slide 3, in a backcountry area of Whiteface that is only opened to skiers when there is enough natural snow and staff has determined there is a minimal threat of avalanches.  McCulley said the landslide didn't damage any infrastructure on the mountain, but there is a pile of debris where it stopped. He did say the spring rains have caused some areas to be washed out and there were some other little slides in other places.","Slide 3, Whiteface mountain, NY",1km,landslide,downpour,small,unknown,0.0,0.0,United States,New York,2521,Lake Placid,11.70793,-73.8973,44.3666,17.7,11.3,14.8,17.7,11.3,14.8,13.6,93.08,28.05,54.17,48.2,16.6,127.9,1014.1,89.2,10.5,0.88,"Rain, Partially cloudy","['72622564776', 'KSLK', 'KPBG', 'KBTV', '72622894740', '72617014742']",1206.0,North America,spring,44,0.0,0,SaLo,SaLo,SaLo,SaLo,SaLo,SaLo,0.7972208261489868,0.8029515743255615,0.805741548538208,0.7995531558990479,0.7890428900718689

The damage comes in the wake of 24.78 inches of rain that fell on Cincinnati during the meteorological spring months of March, April and May, a National Weather Service record in data going back to 1871.  County Engineer William Brayshaw has asked commissioners to fund temporary road fixes nearly every week, up from no such requests the past two years.

A wall of mud rolled off the top of Buck Mountain in Maggie Valley on Feb. 5, sliding 3,000 feet and cutting Rich Cove Road in two places. The slide cut off access to 37 homes and damaged at least four.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Emergency Watershed Protection program is spending $1.3 million there along with a state and local match of about $300,000 to fix the top of the mountain.  The slide happened after a system of retaining walls failed at Ghost Town in the Sky, an amusement park that is in bankruptcy. Maggie Valley will be responsible for hiring an engineer to do the work.  Betty Miner, whose home suffered broken windows and gutters but no serious damage during the slide, said Friday that crews are still working on building a road to the start of the slide.

About 6 inches of mud filled her home in just seconds during yesterday’s monsoon storm.   “See this?” Dews asked.  “Your standard dog door, that’s how it got in the house.”  Once the mud was inside her Hereford home, it spread to almost every corner of the house.

But construction along Talus Drive came to a halt Friday after ground beneath it, gave way.  Nearby resident John Spaid captured emergency repairs Friday night.  It’s adding his concerns about the project in general.  ""This entire slope could let loose,” said pointing at the hillside. “And there's nothing to hold it back.”  Friday's movement was enough to cause part of the road to buckle at Talus Drive and Shangri-La Way Northwest.  Dozens of large concrete barriers and tons of large rocks were hauled in to create a temporary retaining wall.

A landslide on Hanley Road forced the road to close. Engineers said that a landslide is causing the asphalt to erode.  A resident said it would likely be three weeks before Hanley Road is fixed.  Crews are also concerned because there is a water main underneath the road which could be damaged by the slide.  Another closure was reported at Weik Road. One lane of Weik Road was coned off because a giant crack developed in the middle of one of the lanes.  On Tuesday, the left shoulder of the ramp from Ridge Road to southbound Interstate 71 was blocked by barrels after the pavement began to crumble and fall away from the road.  -----  Similar problems have popped up around southwest Ohio and northern Kentucky of late as the rain continues to pour.

That “mess” includes a dozen washed-out culverts and what trail superintendent Jody Spencer called “the mother of all landslides” at the campsite near milepost 13. Sam England described the massive mudslide as being 400 feet long and 150 feet high, obliterating a substantial section of the trail and forcing its closure all the way from Anthony to Caldwell. He said State Parks owns a right-of-way that is only between 20 and 40 feet in width, meaning that a site will need to be found to put the “several thousand tons of debris” that have buried that one section of trail. Further complicating the situation, he said, the disposal site must be out of the flood plain. England estimated the entire cleanup project to restore the trail’s usability will exceed $2 million.

The landslide, reported at 4:40 p.m. Sunday, happened on the Kailua side of the tunnels, just before the hairpin turn. There were no injuries or damage to vehicles.  Crews initially kept open one Kailua-bound lane, but by 7:20 p.m. all Kailua-bound lanes from Waokanaka Street were closed. The lanes were reopened by 3:15 a.m. yesterday.  The landslide may have been caused by water seeping below the upper layers of soil and vegetation, making the cliffside unstable, Meisenzahl said.","Pali hwy, Kailua side of the tunnels near hairpin turn, HI",1km,landslide,rain,medium,above_road,0.0,0.0,United States,Hawaii,2040,Maunawili,1.70783,-157.7865241,21.36945629,26.2,20.6,23.6,26.2,20.6,23.6,20.0,80.99,0.02,4.17,50.95586533403471,18.2,204.7,1015.7,15.4,16.0,0.88,Rain,"['91176022519', 'PHNL', 'PHNG', '91178022551', '91182022521', '91170022508']",266.0,North America,winter,2,0.0,0,ClLo,ClLo,ClLo,ClLo,ClLo,ClLo,1.6865836381912231,1.7610585689544678,1.8320417404174805,1.884699344635009,1.928193211555481

The event, which destroyed more than 1,000 sand bags and filled nearly all the diversion channels -- some more than 10 feet deep -- was caused by an afternoon thunderstorm washing down steep slopes burned by the Tres Lagunas Fire. ""We had about an inch of rain in 45 minutes,"" said ranch manager Bob Ingersoll, who was on the property during the slide. But the slide eventually stopped, leaving mud as deep as 4 feet in a second-story entryway that was groundlevel against the upper slope.

Highway engineers say damage to KY 93 between the 8 and 9 mile marker south of Eddyville is so serious the project is more about rebuilding the roadway rather than repairing it.  The heavy rain that lead to near-record flooding across the region saturated the soil causing the roadway to drop as much as 10 feet along about a 1500-foot section of highway in the Eddy Creek area.  Early estimates indicate the cost of repair will be about $600,000.  This week, a contractor that specializes in landslide repair has drilled and placed steel posts into the slide area to help stabilize the soil.  Starting Monday the crew will drive pilings along the lower edge of the slide to further stabilize the area.

The slide took out a slice of a steep, roughly 70-foot embankment above the 1800 block of Roeder Avenue, across from Squalicum Marina.  No one was hurt, and the nearest home — a green two-story bungalow at 1919 Eldridge Ave. — took no damage to the building or its yard, said Bellingham Assistant Fire Chief Bill Hewett.  Mud, sand and blackberry bushes fell onto the railroad tracks below, covering the northernmost track. Crews from BNSF cleared the debris within minutes.  “The bigger question is what the future stability of the slope is,” Hewett said. The bushes helped to stabilize the hill, he said.  Firefighters called city inspectors to check the safety of the hill and the homes on top of it.

However, some residents have decided to leave for fear that a much bigger slide is on its way.  Geologists went to the site Tuesday morning to check the hill's stability. Crews say the hill is unstable, but there is no indication that there would be a massive slide.  Monday night's slide brought down several small trees and caused some damage to the roof of the garage.  Crews have roped off a section of land near the slide. The manager of a nearby apartment complex says he put up a large tarp on his property in early January to prevent a washout.

Clark County road crews on Monday closed one southbound lane at least until next week, giving them enough time to shore up 25 feet of embankment. Officials expect the repair will cost about $150,000.  “We need to re-establish the integrity of the slope,” said Greg Shafer, operations manager for Clark County Public Works.  Shafer said the lane may remain closed until the end of next week. Additional lane restrictions are possible during paving and repairs.  The highway includes two lanes in each direction, with a center turn lane.  Officials suspect stormwater runoff from heavy rain on Sunday flowed through old guardrail post holes on the west side of the highway, triggering the landslide. A nearby business reported the issue on Monday, prompting the lane closure.  The nearest business is Pioneer Fence, Deck and Supply Co., 11318 N.E. Highway 99. ","near 11318 N.E.

The break happened at about 1:30 a.m. Saturday.  Erik Scott with the Los Angeles Fire Department says the water main break triggered about an eight-foot mudslide. Firefighters responded and helped shut down a nearby road.  Officials are assessing the structural integrity of each of the damaged homes.  Most of the damage occurred in the 8500 block of Appian Way.  CBS2’s Greg Mills said at least two homes were damaged heavily.  Homeowners asked why it took them so long to get help.  One woman found out it could be as long as a year before she is able to move back into her home.  “It’s my girlfriend’s house,” said a man who only wanted to be identified as Greg. “I was just really worried. I said, this house could cave in. This could be a much bigger problem.”  In the back of the house, “I think the mud is probably six feet deep,” Greg said.

But, instead of snow, you have dirt,"" said James Hagadorn, the curator of geology for the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.  ""It happens because it's sliding downhill. It's heavier, and it's slippery. It's like a bar of soap on a board, you wet that board, and that soap is going to slide down,"" he said.  The landslide has recently been repaired.

Shoshone County Public Works has partnered with Bureau of Homeland Security and FEMA in developing a cost effective repair. The estimated total is approximately $210,000, 10 percent of which is Shoshone County's responsibility under this federal program.

The Highway 121/Monticello Road was closed due to a rock slide that left rocks and boulders covering the pavement. Two falling boulders—maintenance workers on the scene said the largest was about 10 feet by 11 feet—dented and cracked the pavement.  As of Friday afternoon, the California Highway Patrol stopped traffic at Kenzo Estate winery, 3200 Monticello Road, near the top of the ridge. The slide was about a half-mile to the north, where workers using a backhoe cleared rocks from the narrow, two-lane road and adjacent hillside.  When the road will reopen remained unclear on Friday. More must be done than clean up and repair the pavement. Caltrans spokesman Vince Jacala said the agency geologists must first make certain the rocks above the road are stable.","Half a mile to the north of 3200 Monticello Road, Napa, CA, USA",exact,rock_fall,rain,small,above_road,0.0,0.0,United States,United States,4325,United States,0.10001,-122.200994,38.359775,13.3,4.1,9.0,13.3,1.8,7.1,2.2,64.2,0.0,0.0,46.4,26.1,285.8,1011.4,9.7,16.0,0.54,Clear,"['74516023202', '72482893241', '72495593227', 'KVCB', 'KAPC', 'KSUU']",340.0,North America,autumn,83,0.0,0,Lo,Lo,Lo,ClLo,ClLo,ClLo,8.528214454650879,8.944381713867188,9.346267700195312,9.657644271850586,9.9244384765625
